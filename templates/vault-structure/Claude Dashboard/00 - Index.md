# Claude Dashboard

Central hub for Claude Code integration with Obsidian.

## Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| [[Inbox]] | Files for Claude to process |
| [[Outbox]] | Files Claude creates |
| [[Reference]] | Persistent context and knowledge |
| [[Session Logs]] | Daily session summaries |
| [[Archive]] | Old or superseded content |

## Quick Access

- [[Scratchpad]] - Working memory for current session
- [[Todo]] - Pending tasks

## How It Works

1. **You** drop files in `Inbox/To Process`
2. **Claude** reads from Inbox, writes to Outbox
3. **Session Logs** track what was done
4. **Reference** persists important context across sessions
5. **Scratchpad** holds temporary working notes
